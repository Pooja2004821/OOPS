        "Q12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method Overriding occurs when a child class (subclass) redefines a method from its parent class (superclass) with the same name, parameters, and return type.When you call the method on an object of the child class, the child’s version of the method is executed — not the parent’s.\n",

        "Q14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is one of the most powerful and important concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows for more flexible, reusable, and maintainable code. Let’s break down why polymorphism is so important!\n",
        "- Key Benefits of Polymorphism in OOP:\n",
        " - Code Reusability : Polymorphism allows you to use the same method name to operate on objects of different types. This avoids writing redundant code, making the program more reusable and scalable.\n",
        "   - Example: A draw() method can be used by both Circle and Square objects, even though each class might have a different implementation of draw().\n",
        " - Flexibility and Extensibility : It provides flexibility to add new classes without modifying existing code. For example, you can introduce a new shape (e.g., Triangle) that also implements the draw() method, and the existing code can handle it without changes.\n",
        "   - Example: If we already have a drawing application with shapes, adding new shapes doesn't require changing how we draw all the current shapes.\n",
        "  - Improves Code Maintenance : Since polymorphism allows you to define methods that can operate on a wide variety of objects, it makes code easier to maintain and extend. You don’t need to write different code for every object type you encounter — just the general method works for all types.\n",
        "  - Promotes Loose Coupling : With polymorphism, objects of different types can interact with one another through common interfaces. This reduces the dependencies between components of the program, promoting loose coupling and high cohesion.\n",
        "   - Example: You can treat all shapes as Shape objects, and polymorphism ensures that the correct method is called based on the actual type of the object (like Circle, Square, etc.).\n",
        "  - Supports Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Dispatch): In languages like Python, polymorphism allows runtime decision-making. This means that the method to call is determined at runtime based on the object, not at compile-time, making programs more dynamic and adaptable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own. It is meant to be inherited by other classes, which must then implement its abstract methods.Abstract methods are methods that are declared in the abstract class but have no implementation. Subclasses are required to provide their own implementation of these methods.Abstract classes allow you to define common interfaces that can be shared by multiple subclasses, ensuring that they all implement certain methods, but leaving the specifics up to the subclass.\n",
        "- Key Points about Abstract Classes:\n",
        "An abstract class can contain both abstract methods (methods without implementation) and concrete methods (methods with implementation).You cannot create an instance of an abstract class directly.You must create a subclass that implements all abstract methods to instantiate an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "1. Modularity : In OOP, programs are divided into smaller, manageable pieces called objects or classes. Each object can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.\n",
        "- Advantage: This modular structure allows for easier maintenance, debugging, and reuse of code. If a change is needed in one part of the system, you can often modify just the relevant object without affecting other parts of the system.\n",
        "2. Reusability (Code Reusability) : OOP promotes the reuse of code. Once a class is written, it can be reused across different parts of the program or even in different programs without modification.\n",
        "- Advantage: Through mechanisms like inheritance, you can extend existing classes, which reduces redundancy and minimizes the need to write duplicate code.\n",
        "- Example: If you have a Vehicle class with general properties and methods, you can create subclasses like Car and Truck that inherit and extend Vehicle's functionality without rewriting common methods.\n",
        "3. Scalability and Maintainability : OOP helps in scaling applications by promoting modular design. Each object can be developed and maintained independently.\n",
        "- Advantage: As a system grows, adding new features or making changes becomes easier. Since objects are loosely coupled and interact through well-defined interfaces, scaling and extending the system is more straightforward.\n",
        "4. Encapsulation : Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. This also includes restricting direct access to certain attributes or methods, allowing controlled access.\n",
        "- Advantage: It helps in protecting the internal state of objects and hiding complexity. This leads to more robust, secure code because internal data is hidden from outside manipulation, and you can only modify it through controlled methods.\n",
        "5. Inheritance : Inheritance allows one class (child or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent or superclass). This facilitates code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships.\n",
        "- Advantage: Inheritance helps in reducing redundancy. Instead of redefining the same methods in multiple places, you can inherit them from a common base class. It also helps in creating specialized versions of a general class.\n",
        "6. Polymorphism : Polymorphism means many forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, particularly when they implement the same method or interface.\n",
        "- Advantage: Polymorphism improves flexibility and extensibility. For example, you can use the same method name to perform different tasks depending on the object that calls it. This makes the code more adaptable and easier to extend without changing the existing codebase.\n",
        "7. Abstraction : Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features to the user. It allows users to interact with objects at a high level.\n",
        "- Advantage: It simplifies the user interface and improves usability by only exposing essential functionality and hiding the complexity behind the scenes. For example, you don’t need to know how a car’s engine works to drive it.\n",
        "8. Improved Collaboration : OOP’s modular design allows developers to work on different parts of the system independently. Each object can be designed, developed, and tested by different teams or individuals.\n",
        "- Advantage: This promotes teamwork and makes it easier for developers to divide work efficiently in large projects.\n",
        "9. Security : OOP allows you to restrict access to certain parts of an object through encapsulation and the use of access modifiers (public, private, protected).\n",
        "- Advantage: This enhances security because it limits direct access to the internal workings of objects and ensures that the data is accessed and modified only through safe and defined interfaces.\n",
        "10. Easier Debugging and Testing : With its modular structure, OOP makes it easier to isolate and test individual objects or components of the system.\n",
        "- Advantage: Unit testing becomes simpler because you can test objects independently. If there’s an issue, you know which object to focus on, making the debugging process faster and more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "1. Definition:\n",
        "- Class Variable : A class variable is a variable that is shared by all instances of a class. It is defined inside the class, but outside of any instance methods. All instances of the class can access and modify the class variable.It is common to all instances of the class and is usually used for values that are shared across all instances.\n",
        "- Instance Variable : An instance variable is a variable that is specific to an instance of the class. It is defined inside an instance method, typically inside the __init__() constructor method. Each object (instance) has its own copy of the instance variable.It is unique to each instance of the class, meaning different objects can have different values for their instance variables.\n",
        "2. Scope :\n",
        "- Class Variable : Shared across all instances of the class. Changes made to a class variable affect all instances that access that variable.\n",

        "3. Declaration :\n",
        "- Class Variable : Declared directly inside the class, but outside any methods (including the constructor __init__).\n",
        "- Instance Variable : Declared inside a method, typically the __init__ constructor, using self.\n",
        "4. Memory Allocation:\n",
        "- Class Variable : Allocated only once in memory, and all instances share the same memory location for the class variable.\n",

        "Q18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance in Python refers to a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. In other words, a child class can derive from multiple parent classes, allowing it to access the functionality of all parent classes.\n",
        "- Key Points About Multiple Inheritance:\n",
        " - Inheritance from Multiple Classes : A class can inherit from multiple classes at the same time, thus combining the functionalities of all the parent classes.\n",
        " - Method Resolution Order (MRO) : When using multiple inheritance, Python follows a specific order to resolve method calls, known as Method Resolution Order (MRO). This order determines which method to invoke when a method is called on an instance of the child class.\n",
        " - Diamond Problem : In multiple inheritance, if two parent classes inherit from a common ancestor, it can lead to a situation called the diamond problem. Python resolves this problem using the C3 Linearization algorithm, which ensures that the classes are called in a consistent order.\n",

        "Q19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "1. __str__ Method : The __str__ method is used to define a human-readable or informal string representation of an object. It is called by the built-in str() function and when you use print() on an object. The goal of the __str__ method is to provide a readable and user-friendly description of the object.\n",
        "- Purpose: To return a string that is easy to understand for end users.\n",
        "- Called by: str() and print().\n",
        "2. __repr__ Method : The __repr__ method is used to define a formal or developer-friendly string representation of an object. Its goal is to provide an unambiguous and detailed description of the object, ideally something that could be used to recreate the object (i.e., if possible). It is called by the built-in repr() function and is used in debugging and logging. The output of __repr__ is meant for developers or debugging, rather than end users.\n",
        "- Purpose: To return a string that is more suitable for debugging, and ideally should provide enough information to recreate the object.\n",
        "- Called by: repr() and when the object is evaluated interactively in the Python shell (e.g., >>>).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- The super() function in Python is a built-in function that allows you to call methods from a parent class (superclass) within a child class (subclass), without directly referencing the parent class. It is often used in the context of inheritance to enable method overriding and calling parent class methods.\n",
        "- Significance and Purpose of super()\n",
        " - Access Parent Class Methods : super() provides a way to call methods from the parent class. This is useful when you want to extend or modify the behavior of the parent class's method in the child class.\n",
        " - Avoid Hardcoding Parent Class Names : Using super() allows you to call the parent class method without explicitly referring to the parent class's name. This is helpful when you have multiple levels of inheritance and want the child class to automatically call the correct parent class method, even if the class hierarchy changes.\n",
        " - Supports Multiple Inheritance : In case of multiple inheritance, super() works well with Python’s Method Resolution Order (MRO). It ensures that the correct method is called from the parent class, even if there are multiple parent classes.\n",
        " - Improves Code Maintainability : By using super(), you avoid explicitly naming parent classes, which improves the maintainability and readability of your code. If the inheritance hierarchy changes, the code still works without modifications.\n",

        "Q21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method in Python is a special method known as a destructor. It is used to define behavior when an object is about to be destroyed or deleted. This method is automatically invoked when an object is garbage collected, which happens when there are no more references to the object and it is ready to be removed from memory.\n",
        "- Significance of the __del__ Method:\n",
        " - Resource Cleanup :The primary purpose of __del__ is to perform any necessary cleanup when an object is being deleted, such as closing files, releasing network connections, or deallocating memory for objects that hold external resources (like database connections, file handles, etc.).\n",
        " - Automatic Deletion : When an object is no longer needed and is about to be garbage collected (i.e., there are no more references to the object), Python will call the __del__ method to allow the object to clean up before it is destroyed.\n",
        " - Preventing Memory Leaks : By defining a __del__ method, you can ensure that resources are freed when an object is deleted, helping to prevent memory leaks or other resource-related issues.\n",

        "- What is Polymorphism? :\n",
        " - Polymorphism means \"many forms\". In programming, it refers to the ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways.\n",
        "- How It Works with Inheritance? :\n",
        " - In Python, when a class inherits from another class, it can override methods from the parent class. Polymorphism allows you to use these child class methods interchangeably using the parent class reference.\n",
        "- Example :\n",
        " - class Animal:\n",
        "    - def speak(self):\n",
        "        - return \"Some sound\"\n",
        "\n",
        " - class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    - def speak(self):\n",
        "        - return \"Woof!\"\n",
        " - class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    - def speak(self):\n",
        "        - return \"Meow!\"\n",
        " - #Polymorphism in action\n",
        " - def make_animal_speak(animal):\n",

        "Q24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining in Python (and in OOP in general) is a technique where you call multiple methods on the same object in a single line of code. It helps make the code cleaner and more fluent, especially when performing a sequence of operations.\n",
        "- How Method Chaining Works? :\n",
        " - It relies on each method returning self, so that the next method can be called on the same object.\n",
        "- Example :\n",
        "  - class Person:\n",
        "    - def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        - self.name = name\n",

        "Q25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__ method in Python is a special (magic/dunder) method that allows an instance of a class to be called like a function.\n",
        "- Purpose of __call__ :\n",
        " - It lets you define what should happen when you \"call\" an object as if it were a function.\n",
